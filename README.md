My key projects include:
• Deploying Two-Tier Architecture with Terraform:
- Designed and implemented VPC with public and private subnets, configured and deployed EC2 with Apache/NGINX web server and RDS MySQL database, and created security groups to control access.
- Used Terraform Cloud for CI/CD to automate deployment and management.

• Automating EC2 Instances with CloudWatch, Lambda (Python), and API Gateway:
- Developed Python Lambda function using Boto3 library to identify and shut down tagged EC2 instances, created CloudWatch event rule to trigger Lambda function based on specified conditions or schedules, and configured API Gateway for manual Lambda function execution.

• Deployed Jenkins Server and CI/CD Pipeline with Docker:
- Used Docker CLI to run Jenkins, map ports, and create data persistence volume; extracted admin password, set up Jenkins instance, installed plugins, and created users; implemented Docker Compose file to define and run Jenkins configurations; and verified setup by launching new Jenkins
container with shared volume to ensure data persistence.

• Deployed Web Server in Auto Scaling Group with Load Balancer via Terraform:
- Configured Amazon Linux AMI and defined subnets to ensure high availability using Terraform; implemented EC2 Auto Scaling Group and Application Load Balancer (ALB) for dynamic traffic management and resource scaling; and used S3 for Terraform state file storage and secure, efficient infrastructure management.
